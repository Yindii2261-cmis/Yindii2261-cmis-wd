			<ol>
			  <li>
				Open terminal tab and enter the cloning command: "git clone --config="http.proxy=http://yindii2261:magix@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/Yindii2261-cmis/Yindii2261-cmis-wd.git"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Then type in the command "cd" and put in your directory name: "cd Yindii2261-cmis-wd"
			  </l>
			  <li>
				Put in "gedit (insert file name).html" : "gedit listandlinks.html"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				This is will open a new window called gedit which'll allow you to edit your html file. Now you can put whatever things you need in it but you need to have certain tags. Tags operate similarly to a 'family' system. The 'parents' will be in the first column, the 'children' on the second column (basically means tabbing once), the grand children on the third column (tab two times), and so on. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the first line put "<!doctype html>". This is a parent so no tabbing needed.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the second line put "<html>". This is also a parent. 
			  </li> 
			  <li>
				On the third line, press tab and then put an opening tag: "<head>". This is a 'child' so it'll be in the second column.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the fourth line, press tab two times and put an opening tag: "<title>". This is the children of the children so it has to be in another, third, column. The reason why it's a child of header is because it will be seen in the header. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the fifth line, tab three times and put what ever you want the title to be. This is the great-grand children so it'll be 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the sixth line, tab two times and put the closing tag: "</title>"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the seventh line, tab two times and put "<meta charset=utf-8/>"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the eighth line, tab once and put "<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="selectors.css"/>". This will give a link to your css file so that you can edit and alter the appearance of your website page. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				For the next line, tab once and put the closing tag for head : "</head>"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				On the tenth line, after tabbing once, you'll put a similar tag to head : "<body>"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Next line, tab twice, and put opening tag: "<header>"
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Next line, tab three times and put whatever you want as your header, most probably the title again since the other one won't show up directly on your page.	
			  </li>
				Then put the closing tab on the next line, make sure it's in the same 'column' as the opening tag : </head>
