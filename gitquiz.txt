Step 1: I'd enter the classroom
Step 2: Turn on my computer and log on
Step 3: Open my email (where I would have my cloning code) and Terminal
Step 4: Copy and paste my cloning code into the Terminal (git clone --config="http.proxy=http://yindii2261:magix@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/Yindii2261-cmis/Yindii2261-cmis-wd.git), then press enter
Step 5: Type 'cd' then after space, type the name of my repository (cd Yindii2261-cmis-wd/); press enter
Step 6: I'd type gedit and after space, type file.txt (gedit file.txt); gedit will be opened up with a new file named file.txt
Step 7: I'd put whatever information in that file (edit it however I need to) 
Step 8: I would often press the save button every now and then incase the computer crashes or something unexpected happens
Step 9: Once done, I save it again and close the gedit tab
Step 10: Type git add and put in the name of my file, I could just type file then press tab, (git add file.txt); hit enter
Step 11: I'll type git commit -m "Editted file.txt" (git commit -m "Editted file.txt); hit enter
Step 12: Then type git push (nothing else needed)
Step 13: Fill out my username (Yindii2261-cmis) and password in the correct boxes (for the password, the characters will not show for privacy)
Step 14: To double check that everything is saved in my repository, I go to github.com, login, and go to my repository where file.txt should appear along with my other files
Step 15: When the bell rings, I'll sign out of all my accounts, close down all the tabs
Step 16: Turn off my computer and leave the room with a smile on my face :)
